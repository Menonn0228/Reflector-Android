# Reflector - Android
The following README will contain all necessary information for new developers and additional resources to guide development.

## Application Description
The Reflector mobile application allows users to view articles posted on [The Reflector](https://www.reflector-online.com/) official website. This project uses **RSS Feeds** from the website to scrape and present data. The RSS feeds are derived from BloxCMS and documentation can for [here](https://help.bloxcms.com/knowledge-base/applications/editorial/assets/tasks/article_504ccd62-2bfd-11e5-8804-131eebdc4425.html) on how to use it.

## Overall Project Goal for Developers
Develop a quality-focused app that radiates with simplicity and stability while maintaining a strong code base with detailed documentation within the project. With this goal in mind, we can ensure that future developers will have an easy time jumping in; and the folks at The Reflector can get an app worth showing to our dawgs.

## Technical Application Specifications

### Build Information
* Language: Kotlin 1.3.70
* Supported Devices: Android 8.0 or Newer

### Primary Design Architecture
**MVVM** â€” For those not familiar with this architecture, this is called Model View ViewModel. Basically, you have your Model (Data), a View (The interface), and a ViewModel for each view. The ViewModel classes will only contain the data from a model  that needs to be presented in that view. This separation allows for the Views to avoid interacting with the model data. The ViewModels should tell the View what to display. Research MVVM in Kotlin for more information.

### Dependencies Used
